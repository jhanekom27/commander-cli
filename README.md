# commander-cli

Our beginning commander utility tool for tracking all MTG Commander things.

Our little practise project to boost our python skills. Starting with a simple command line interface and then expand to more complex things.

## Development

Intructions for how to get the code installed to run/develop on your computer.

Also housekeeping rules we want to stick to to keep the code tidy.

### Git

Will be using `git flow` methodology to keep things nice and tidy.

## Future Plans

### Near future

* Simple command line interface
* Things to track:
  * Commander life per player
  * Summonder damage to each player by each player
  * Number of commander summons

### Far future

* User interface of some kind
* Use something like 'Click' to do all the CLI nexting
